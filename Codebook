# To Initiate the Project

Download data from provided links to online sources.  Unzip to a R directory.

# Write the R script to solve the stated problem: 
The "analysis.R" file executes the five steps stated in the problem. 
- Merging the training the test sets to create one data set.
- Reading files
- Assigning names to columns
- Merging all data in one set
- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Reading column names
- Create vector for defining names, mean and standard deviation
- Subsetting for all merged data
- Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Properly labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
- Making second tidy data set
- Writing second tidy data set in txt file

# The variables that were used in the script: 

trainX, trainy, testX, testy, trainD and testD are the provided data which were into the dplyr dataframe using the tbl_df function.
 Those then generated a new set of data variables as are presented in the code. The data were then merged to produce a single data frame for analysis.

# Packages Installed: 
 tidyr & dplyr
